          <h1>Earth</h1>
          <p class="poem">
            The Earth once a lonely place,<br>
            Gave man a chance to live,<br>
            Man was happy and filled with grace,<br>
            And to earth, he used to give.<br><br>

            As time progressed,<br>
            And Man grew old,<br>
            He gained power,<br>
            And became too bold.<br><br>

            Earth being gentle and graceful,<br>
            Was happy for man as one can be,<br>
            Gave man everything his handful,<br>
            But man for power was too thirsty.<br><br>

            Man hurt her feelings,<br>
            And hurt her pride,<br>
            And made her watch,<br>
            As the animals cried.<br><br>

            Earth now had seen enough,<br>
            To teach man his rightful place,<br>
            This time it was not a bluff,<br>
            But truly her angry face.<br><br>

            With a burst of wrath,<br>
            she growled at man,<br>
            Enough to scare him,<br>
            for his lifespan.<br><br>

            And with that, she reminded him that,<br>
            She was the master, not the slave.<br>

          <h1>Places</h1>
        <p class="poem">
            Some places are meant for its Beauty,<br>
            Some places are meant for its Peace,<br>
            Some places are just like lock and key,<br>
            Fits just right and puts you at ease.<br><br>

            Some places are meant for its memories,<br>
            Some places are meant to be seen,<br>
            Some places will rid you of worries,<br>
            For all you who look with eyes keen.<br><br>

            Some places are meant to be free,<br>
            Some places are meant to have fun,<br>
            Some places are meant for a cup of tea,<br>
            For those who are too old to run.<br><br>

            No matter the place or its purpose,<br>
            One thing that I can guarantee,<br>
            Is that people give meanings to places,<br>
            And those mean on for eternity.<br>

          <h1>Spark</h1>
          <p class="poem">
              There was always inside, a spark,<br>
              That could be seen just in the dark,<br>
              Just waiting for the time that's right,<br>
              To burn into a flame that's bright.<br><br>
  
              Look at it and see it struggling,<br>
              A volcano that's hot and bubbling,<br>
              A Champaign cork waiting to pop,<br>
              A rappers mic waiting to drop.<br><br>
  
              Held back by doubt and inhibition,<br>
              By lack of meaning or definition,<br>
              Always under much suspicion,<br>
              With no proper supervision.<br><br>
  
              Give it a chance and see it blooming,<br>
              Try it once just stop assuming,<br>
              You'll not know what all it's fuming,<br>
              What it does with proper grooming.<br><br>
  
              There is always inside, a spark,<br>
              That all can see not just in the dark,<br>
              But don't wait for the time that's right,<br>
              Just burn into a flame that's bright.<br>
