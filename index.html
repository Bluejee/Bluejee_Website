          <h1>Hey There, This is me!</h1>
          <p>Hi, I'm Balakrishna. I'm a passionate explorer of the world of science and technology. These explorations have
            led me to tinker with lots of DIY projects and explore physics and computer science, constantly motivating
            me to learn new things. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.ibab.ac.in/">Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology</a> in Bangalore.</p>
          <p>Apart from academics, I love coding and exploring new ideas. I enjoy constructive debates and discussions
            on a
            wide array of topics. I'm also passionate about teaching and mentoring. I believe that we can improve
            ourselves
            and the world by sharing our knowledge. I always strive to inspire people to be passionate and pursue their
            interests rather than being a part of the rat race.</p>
          <p>One of my long-term goals is to build a community of like-minded people where each motivates others to
            learn
            and grow together. As humans, we're limited in many abilities, especially the ability to utilize time. There
            are
            only 24 hours in a day for any given person, but when people come together, time multiplies, and we can
            achieve
            much more than we could alone.</p>
          <p>In line with these thoughts, I strongly advocate open-source software and Creative Commons. I believe that
            knowledge should be freely accessible to everyone, and no one should be denied access to it. I've benefited
            a
            lot from the open-source community, and I am a result of the work built upon the foundations laid by many
            others. And as Newton once said, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</p>
          <p>In short, I'm a physics lover, tech enthusiast, lifelong learner, reliable mentor, an advocate of open
            knowledge, and a believer in collaboration. I look forward to finding and connecting with others who share
            these
            beliefs and make the world a better place.</p>

      <p>I have always been fascinated by the remarkable advancements that humans have achieved throughout the ages.

I consider myself an adventurer in this ongoing exploration.</p>
      <p>Research holds a special place in my heart, representing a realm where my passion thrives. Through various projects, I've gained profound insights into the intricacies of our world and its workings.</p>
      <p>Here, I present a glimpse of some projects that have not only inspired me but have also been instrumental in providing valuable lessons. These are just a few among many, and I invite you to delve deeper if your curiosity is piqued.</p>
