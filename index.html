          <h1>Hey There, This is me!</h1>
          <p>Hi, I'm Balakrishna. I'm a passionate explorer of the world of science and technology. These explorations
            have
            led me to tinker with lots of DIY projects and explore physics and computer science, constantly motivating
            me to learn new things. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the <a
              href="https://www.ibab.ac.in/">Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology</a> in Bangalore.</p>
          <p>Apart from academics, I love coding and exploring new ideas. I enjoy constructive debates and discussions
            on a
            wide array of topics. I'm also passionate about teaching and mentoring. I believe that we can improve
            ourselves
            and the world by sharing our knowledge. I always strive to inspire people to be passionate and pursue their
            interests rather than being a part of the rat race.</p>
          <p>One of my long-term goals is to build a community of like-minded people where each motivates others to
            learn
            and grow together. As humans, we're limited in many abilities, especially the ability to utilize time. There
            are
            only 24 hours in a day for any given person, but when people come together, time multiplies, and we can
            achieve
            much more than we could alone.</p>
          <p>In line with these thoughts, I strongly advocate open-source software and Creative Commons. I believe that
            knowledge should be freely accessible to everyone, and no one should be denied access to it. I've benefited
            a
            lot from the open-source community, and I am a result of the work built upon the foundations laid by many
            others. And as Newton once said, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</p>
          <p>In short, I'm a physics lover, tech enthusiast, lifelong learner, reliable mentor, an advocate of open
            knowledge, and a believer in collaboration. I look forward to finding and connecting with others who share
            these
            beliefs and make the world a better place.</p>

      <h1>My Research Projects</h1>
      <p>I have always been fascinated by the remarkable advancements that humans have achieved throughout the ages.
        These achievements stems from our innate ability to question the unknown and venture boldly into uncharted
        territories in search of answers. I consider myself an adventurer in this ongoing exploration.</p>
      <p>Research holds a special place in my heart, representing a realm where my passion thrives. Through various
        projects, I've gained profound insights into the intricacies of our world and its workings.</p>
      <p>Here, I present a glimpse of some projects that have not only inspired me but have also been instrumental in
        providing valuable lessons. These are just a few among many, and I invite you to delve deeper if your curiosity
        is piqued.</p>

          <h2>How Inteligents are Ants?</h2>
          <p>Ants are simple creatures, and often seem to be stupid when looked at individually.</p>
          <p>As a collony though, its a different story. They have amazing mechanisms through which they collaborate and
            solve problems to figure out how to survive and forage food.</p>
          <p>Understanding Complex Behaviours in Multi-Agent systems using Reinforcement Learning, is a project which
            aims to gain insights on the emergent
            phenomena that can be observed in the physical world using Reinforcement Learning and Physics</p>

      <h1>My Hobby Projects</h1>
      <p>We've all heard the phrase "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." It's been a sanctuary for me when the
        stress of research and academics looms large. In these moments, I escape into my own world, tinkering with
        electronics, building simulations, creating games, and diving into various other pursuits.</p>
      <p>Among the many things I enjoy during my downtime, I have a special corner reserved for what I call my hobby
        projects. These are my time investments, hours poured into learning and experimenting until, finally, that
        "Eureka!" moment arrives, and I'm bouncing around like a kid on a trampoline.</p>
      <p>Here, I present a glimpse of these geeky and nerdy pleasures of mine. While these projects reflect part of my
        creative journey, there's still an abundance waiting to be uncovered.</p>

      <div class="carousel">
        <a href="https://github.com/Bluejee/Sudoku_Solver" class="floating_card">
          <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
          <p>Sudoku, for some, is a brain-busting puzzle; for others, it's a relaxing pastime.</p>
          <p>When faced with an unsolvable puzzle online, I opted to build my own solver rather than seek an answer
            elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Through this project, I explored perfect sudokus, backtracking, and other intriguing concepts and
            algorithms.</p>
          <p>Now, it's a handy tool that swiftly solves puzzles, but only when we are fed up of solving it ourselves.

          <h2>Firefly Synchronization</h2>
          <p>Fireflies are mesmerizing with their bioluminescence, captivating both young and old.</p>
          <p>Inspired by their synchronized blinking in nature, I simulated this emergent behavior in a swarm of
            fireflies.</p>
          <p>Exploring the complexities of emergent behavior, I employed mathematical rules to orchestrate
            synchronization among individual fireflies, observing them eventually blink in unison.</p>

        <a href="hobby_project_3.html" class="floating_card">
          <h2>ASCII Art</h2>
          <p>Have you ever thought about the concept of images being built with tiny building blocks called pixels?</p>
          <p>Digital images, when observed closely, are formed by varying pixel intensities. I delved into the realm of
            digital art, exploring how these pixels don't have to be rigid blocks.</p>
          <p>I discovered a unique approach of using keyboard characters in place of pixels. Although this concept isn't
            entirely novel, my inspiration from various creators led me to create my own spinoff of this work.</p>

      <h1>Let's Get Personal</h1>
      <p>Art and literature grant us liberation from the rigid confines of rules, offering a canvas where we can freely
        bend, break, and recreate without limitations. It's an artistic freedom that lets us redefine grammar, painting
        palettes, writing conventions, or even the placement of a cameraâ€”where every rule is an invitation to break
        them.</p>
      <p>There are moments when experiences or emotions drive me to pen down my thoughts. Sometimes, words fall short in
        capturing what I feel, leading me to express through photos, videos, or mixing them into a singular creation.
        I've even on Occasion, let my hand sketch whatever springs to mind, and while I wouldn't call myself an artist
        in the traditional sense, these ventures open a window into my inner self.</p>
      <p>But in any case, perfection has never been the aim, instead, It is the imperfections that render these
        creations valuable and genuine.</p>

          <p>One such thought that stuck was that, Learning from the mistake of others is sometimes more important than
            making those mistakes ourself to learn from them.</p>
          <p>This certainly helps me have an open view and empathise with others, and maybe my mistakes and experiences

      <h1>The Doubt Factory</h1>
      <p>Questioning things has been a significant part of my life, bringing me immense pleasure and satisfaction. Since
        childhood, I've been known as the kid who asks the most questions, Despite becoming the subject of jokes and
        teasing, I could never stop asking doubts. I'm certain I'm not alone in this experience. However, I've noticed many
        people give up on their curiosity and cease to ask questions. What most fail to see is the sheer joy of
        questioning, being curious, and ultimately finding the solutions.</p>

      <p>The current state of the world often portrays learning as uncool and tedious, but in truth, it's far from it.
        This misconception stems from years of misrepresentation of science, technology, and various aspects of the
        world. While I don't imply that the current system is entirely flawed, my own encounters with such issues reveal
        the extensive room for improvement.</p>

      <p>I consider myself part of a privileged group with access to excellent education and unwavering support from my
        family to nurture curiosity and choose my paths. I acknowledge that not everyone shares the same fortune. I
        strongly believe that those bestowed with privilege should strive to extend similar benefits to others.</p>

      <p>In essence, I aim to provide similar privileges to as many individuals as possible. This is the essence of my
        concept, The Doubt Factory. To all those inquisitive minds, to the child within everyone who dared to ask
        'silly' questions, experiment, try new things, and innocently pestered their parents and others with their
        curiosity - to you, I'd like to say this:</p>

      <p>I know I cannot change the system, at least not right now. So I Embark upon a journey to let you know that you
        are not alone, that asking questions is not wrong, that the universe is ready with the answers, just waiting for
        us to ask the right questions.We may have to confront hundreds or even thousands of seemingly trivial and silly
        questions before we uncover the right problems. Who knows, our doubts might just change the world.</p>

      <p>And for that I give you <a href="https://github.com/thedoubtfactory">"The Doubt Factory"</a></p>
