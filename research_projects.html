        <h1>My Research Projects</h1>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by the remarkable advancements that humans have achieved throughout the ages.
          These achievements stem from our innate ability to question the unknown and venture boldly into uncharted
          territories in search of answers. I consider myself an adventurer in this ongoing exploration.</p>
        <p>Research holds a special place in my heart, representing a realm where my passion thrives. Through various
          projects, I've gained profound insights into the intricacies of our world and its workings.</p>
        <p>Here, I present a glimpse of some projects that have not only inspired me but have also been instrumental in
          providing valuable lessons. These are just a few among many, and I invite you to delve deeper if your curiosity
          is piqued.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/Bluejee/OpenLIBS" class="floating_card">
          <h2>LIBS for All</h2>
          <p>Lasers, a marvel of scientific discovery, have proven invaluable in solving innumerable challenges.</p>
          <p>Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), a branch of laser physics, involves directing laser pulses
            onto materials, studying the resulting plasma to gain insights into the sample.</p>
          <p>Introducing OpenLIBS: an open-source Python package designed for the computational analysis of LIBS
            spectra. It empowers users to conduct qualitative analysis based on LIBS data.</p>

        <a href="https://github.com/Bluejee/Ant_Foraging_MNEST" class="floating_card">
          <h2>How Intelligent are Ants?</h2>
          <p>Ants are simple creatures, and often seem to be stupid when looked at individually.</p>
          <p>As a colony though, it's a different story. They have amazing mechanisms through which they collaborate and
            solve problems to figure out how to survive and forage food.</p>
          <p>Understanding Complex Behaviours in Multi-Agent systems using Reinforcement Learning, is a project which
            aims to gain insights on the emergent
            phenomena that can be observed in the physical world using Reinforcement Learning and Physics</p>
        </a>
        <a href="https://github.com/Bluejee/Basics_of_Chaos" class="floating_card">
          <h2>Deciphering Chaos</h2>
          <p>The allure of chaos captivates us all, evoking notions of freedom and possibility. Terms like the butterfly
            effect have become common even for teenagers, yet chaos remains a misunderstood enigma.</p>
          <p>Contrary to popular portrayal, delving into chaos theory offers insights that underpin our world.</p>
          <p>"Chaos - Interpreting the Physical Pendulum and the Chaotic Ratchet", is a project that aims to explore the
            field of dynamical systems such and study the counterintuitive workings of the physical pendulum and the
            Chaotic Ratchet. </p>

          <h2>I'll be putting more cards ASAP</h2>
          <p>The Cards that are supposed to come here are with the manufacturers. All Completed projects are there in my
            GitHub though.</p>
          <p>So Until I get the cards and set things up over here, Visit my GitHub to see my work.</p>
