<h1>Places</h1>
<p>
    Some places are meant for its Beauty,<br>
    Some places are meant for its Peace,<br>
    Some places are just like lock and key,<br>
    Fits just right and puts you at ease.<br><br>

    Some places are meant for its memories,<br>
    Some places are meant to be seen,<br>
    Some places will rid you of worries,<br>
    For all you who look with eyes keen.<br><br>

    Some places are meant to be free,<br>
    Some places are meant to have fun,<br>
    Some places are meant for a cup of tea,<br>
    For those who are too old to run.<br><br>

    No matter the place or its purpose,<br>
    One thing that I can guarantee,<br>
    Is that people give meanings to places,<br>
    And those mean on for eternity.<br>
