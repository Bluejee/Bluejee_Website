        <p class="poem">
            The Earth once a lonely place,<br>
            Gave man a chance to live,<br>
            Man was happy and filled with grace,<br>
            And to earth, he used to give.<br><br>

            As time progressed,<br>
            And Man grew old,<br>
            He gained power,<br>
            And became too bold.<br><br>

            Earth being gentle and graceful,<br>
            Was happy for man as one can be,<br>
            Gave man everything his handful,<br>
            But man for power was too thirsty.<br><br>

            Man hurt her feelings,<br>
            And hurt her pride,<br>
            And made her watch,<br>
            As the animals cried.<br><br>

            Earth now had seen enough,<br>
            To teach man his rightful place,<br>
            This time it was not a bluff,<br>
            But truly her angry face.<br><br>

            With a burst of wrath,<br>
            she growled at man,<br>
            Enough to scare him,<br>
            for his lifespan.<br><br>

            And with that, she reminded him that,<br>
            She was the master, not the slave.<br>
