<h1>Earth</h1>
<p>
    The Earth once a lonely place,<br>
    Gave man a chance to live,<br>
    Man was happy and filled with grace,<br>
    And to earth, he used to give.<br><br>

    As time progressed,<br>
    And Man grew old,<br>
    He gained power,<br>
    And became too bold.<br><br>

    Earth being gentle and graceful,<br>
    Was happy for man as one can be,<br>
    Gave man everything his handful,<br>
    But man for power was too thirsty.<br><br>

    Man hurt her feelings,<br>
    And hurt her pride,<br>
    And made her watch,<br>
    As the animals cried.<br><br>

    Earth now had seen enough,<br>
    To teach man his rightful place,<br>
    This time it was not a bluff,<br>
    But truly her angry face.<br><br>

    With a burst of wrath,<br>
    she growled at man,<br>
    Enough to scare him,<br>
    for his lifespan.<br><br>

    And with that, she reminded him that,<br>
    She was the master, not the slave.<br>
