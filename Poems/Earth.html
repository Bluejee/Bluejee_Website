<h1>Earth</h1>
<p>
    The Earth once a lonely place,
    Gave man a chance to live,
    Man was happy and filled with grace,
    And to earth, he used to give.

    As time progressed ,
    And Man grew old.
    He gained power,
    And became too bold.

    Earth being gentle and graceful,
    Was happy for man as one can be.
    Gave man everything his handful,
    But man for power was too thirsty.

    Man hurt her feelings,
    And hurt her pride.
    And made her watch,
    As the animals cried.

    Earth now had seen enough,
    To teach man his rightful place.
    This time it was not a bluff,
    But truely her angry face.

    With a burst of wrath
    she growled at man,
    Enough to scare him
    for his lifespan.

    And with it she reminded him that,
    She was the master, not the slave.b
