<h1>Spark</h1>
<p>
    There was always inside, a spark,<br>
    That could be seen just in the dark,<br>
    Just waiting for the time that's right,<br>
    To burn into a flame that's bright.<br><br>

    Look at it and see it struggling,<br>
    A volcano that's hot and bubbling,<br>
    A Champaign cork waiting to pop,<br>
    A rappers mic waiting to drop.<br><br>

    Held back by doubt and inhibition,<br>
    By lack of meaning or definition,<br>
    Always under much suspicion,<br>
    With no proper supervision.<br><br>

    Give it a chance and see it blooming,<br>
    Try it once just stop assuming,<br>
    You'll not know what all it's fuming,<br>
    What it does with proper grooming.<br><br>

    There is always inside, a spark,<br>
    That all can see not just in the dark,<br>
    But don't wait for the time that's right,<br>
    Just burn into a flame that's bright.<br>
