          An interesting thought I got while wondering what to have for lunch is
          to try out something new, something exciting. A recent suggestion from
          an acquaintance in the HBCSE Campus pointed me toward Chinese food.
          Although I looked for other places, knowing this one would be
          expensive, I somehow decided to give it a shot and thus began my
          journey for the day.

        <p id="auto_para" class="para_5_2">
          I looked on Google Maps and found that the best way to reach the place
          would be to catch an auto. Finding the shop's location was not a big
          deal it was right on the side of the road and had huge boards to
          welcome people. What surprised me was the change in the ambiance as I
          walked inside the shop.

          The change in ambiance is very apparent as you walk into the hallway
          from a dusty highway filled with vehicles and people. The noises
          suddenly disappear, and the atmosphere becomes serene. The transition
          from chaos to order is apparent. It was interesting to see that the
          actual restaurant is a culmination of two parts, partially joined
          together. Straight ahead into the hallway, the door to enter the China
          Bistro can be seen. Just to the right of the door is the entrance to a
          place named the Indian Bistro. add 3 images of the restaurants

          I was warmly welcomed by a waiter who showed me to my seat. The
          restaurant was sufficiently seated, not too much to call it filled but
          not too less to call it inactive. I opted for a corner seat as it
          would give me enough privacy and a good view of the restaurant. Unlike
          many Chinese restaurants, which usually go for a dark interior, they
          chose to go with a modern design with good ambient lighting. add image

        <p class="para_2_3">
          I was given a menu for the buffet lunch and a standard menu with all
          available foods. I was also given a menu for drinks and beverages. The
          traditional menu showed me that any food item I chose would cost me
          around 400 rupees. From what I know about myself, I was pretty sure I
          wouldn't be satisfied with just one dish. So, seeing that the buffet
          lunch was priced at 599 + tax and service charges, I chose to go on
          the buffet adventure.
        </p>
        <p class="para_2_5">
          Somehow it felt that I had to give myself a treat and that I had to
          live my life while I could. I don't generally like to spend too much
          on food as I can get a lot more quantity for the same price. Still,
          today it felt like maybe the experience must also be given a chance.

        <h2 class="chapter_title">The Appetizers.</h2>
        <p style="grid-column: span 2">
          The buffet meal started with me being given an appetizer plate, a
          soup, and a welcome drink. I expected to receive one dish from each
          section of the menu. The first dish served was "Cottage Cheese Jiang's
          Chilli," basically paneer alongside a cup of "Veg Eight Treasure
          Soup." <br />
          <br />

          style="grid-row: 3"
        />
        <p style="grid-column: 2 / span 1; grid-row: 2 / span">
          I was asked to pick one from peach ice tea, lemon ice tea, soft
          drinks, or lime soda as my welcome drink. The peach iced tea felt like
          the most royal taste I could experience among them, so that was my
          choice.
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: 2/3/3/5; justify-content: center">
          The soup was thick and creamy. It had a sweet yet slightly salty
          flavor and was not over-saturated with cream or sauce. It was
          translucent with tiny pieces of veggies floating around, and the
          temperature felt just right.
          <br />
          <br />
          The soup in itself was exquisite and gave a sense of fulfillment.
          <br />
          <br />
          The paneer had a chewy texture and a flavor with a tint of soy sauce.
          It was creamy and melted in my mouth. It was adequately coated in its
          sauce, but not too much that it looked oily. I was given a generous
          amount to eat.<br />
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: 3/4/4/5">
          As I expected the appetizers to end, I was surprised with another
          appetizer from the menu, The "Lemon Chilli Potato." The name itself
          gave me chills. It felt magical even to think of that combination. The
          taste matched my expectations, and it was fantastic. The lemon gave it
          a zesty touch, and the chili gave it its punch. The potato, as usual,
          was an excellent piece in binding the two together with its mushy and
          creamy texture. Although not crunchy like some French fries, it was
          crispy and soft. It was a masterpiece and some of the best potato
          wedges I've had to date.

        />
        <p style="grid-area: 2/6/3/7">
          Although the paneer was the more anticipated dish on the menu, the
          potato wedges stole the show with their incredible texture.
          <br />
          <br />
          The peach ice tea cleansed the mouth for re-experiencing the taste of
          other dishes, and the sweetness in the soup balanced everything out.
          <br />
          Once again, I was surprised by the arrival of more appetizers. I was
          presented with a serving of "Veg Coriander Dumplings," which the
          waiter called a "Dimsum," and "Vegetable Spring Rolls."
          <br />
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: 3/5/4/7">
          Not knowing what to expect, I put my first ever dumpling in my mouth.
          This came nowhere near the potato or the paneer. Inside the dumpling
          were some chopped coriander and maybe some veggies, while the outer
          shell was of a translucent rubbery texture. The spring roll was like a
          small tightly wrapped veg samosas, not too royal but not too dull, and
          until now, the potato wedges and paneer hold the lead.
          <br />
          The last paneer piece on the plate was eaten with a heavy heart.
          Followed by the spring roll and the dumpling. Saving the best for the
          last, I ate the final potato wedge and the last spoon of soup.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although the place had other drinks, I remained with my round of iced
          tea. It was refreshing and of enough quantity that I didn't feel the
          need for another.
          <br />
          <br />
          The soup and the appetizers were filling, but the war was yet to
          start.
          <br />
          <br />

            style="grid-area: 3/3/4/4"
          />
          The soup and appetizers were served to me at the table, so I didn't
          know what I was supposed to do. Was I to wait? or go get the main
          course myself? I observed the restaurant while waiting for someone to
          give me directions on what next. The place was really considerate of
          vegetarians. The veg section of the menu was not inferior in quantity
          or quality, and it made me feel good about the place even more.

        <h2 class="chapter_title">The Main Course</h2>
        <p style="grid-area: 2/1/3/3">
          The waiter saw me wondering and informed me that I could go and pick
          what I wanted to eat from the buffet.
          <br />
          <br />
          For my base course, I got a portion of "Vegetable Fried Rice" and some
          "Vegetable Chilli Butter Noodles."
          <br />
          <img
            src="Images/Main_Course_1.jpg"
            alt="Main Course 1"
            class="image_1_1"
          />
          For the first part of my main course, I got some "Veg Dumplings in
          Chilli Soya Sauce" and "Stir-fried Asian Vegetables." The stir-fried
          Asian veggies looked more blanched than stir-fried, while the
          dumplings looked like veg Manchurians in the sauce. Both of them had
          an excellent relaxing taste. I've been looking for the preparation of
          such veggies for quite some time, and it is something I would love to
          have almost daily.
          <br />
          <br />
          The rice was not sticky and was well cooked. The vegetables were
          noticeable but did not overpower the rice. The noodles, like their
          name, had a buttery flavor. It was not spicy but also not bland. The
          rice and the noodles tasted terrific, along with the dumpling sauce.
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: 2/3/3/5">
          I hadn't yet taken two of the main course dishes that were waiting for
          me, I wanted to, but the lack of space on my plate kept me from doing
          so.
          <br />
          <br />
          The peach ice tea kept refreshing the palate and kept things cool.
          <br />
          <br />
          After finishing the first two main dishes while still keeping some of
          my rice and noodles on the plate, I tried the other two.
          <img
            src="Images/Main_Course_2.jpg"
            alt="Main Course 2"
            class="image_1_1"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Exotic Seasonal Vegetables in Parsley Sauce" looked much more
          exquisite than I imagined. The "Corn and Potato in Tsing Hoi Sause"
          was mostly seen to be untouched by people. I guess it's because most
          couldn't reach till here, having hoarded the first dishes into their
          stomachs.
          <br />
          <br />
          The veggies in parsley sauce tasted like a soup on a sweeter side. The
          potato and corn were creamy and mushy, probably due to the potato. It
          was not too spicy, contrary to its fiery red looks.
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: 2/5/3/7">
          The rice tasted fantastic with both dishes, but the noodles lacked the
          punch when taken with the parsley sauce. I prefer the veggies in
          parsley sauce as a stand-alone dish rather than as a main course with
          the rice.
          <br />
          <br />
          After finishing the rice and noodles, I ate a second serving of rice
          with the main courses. I did not do the same for the noodles as the
          rice felt richer and a better combination with the sauces, and
          frankly, I was running out of space to eat more.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once I was done with the plate, I was still craving the veggies, so I
          went to get the two of them again. I got both the Asian and exotic
          veggies.
          <br />
          <img
            src="Images/Main_Course_3.jpg"
            alt="Main Course 3"
            class="image_1_1"
          />
          The spinach in the Asian stir-fried vegetables had a lovely texture,
          and the baby corn in both dishes was terrific. Even though the sauce
          was what gave the taste to the exotic veggies, the sauce alone felt
          tiring.
          <br />
          <br />
          After finishing the main course, I set out to see what was for
          dessert. I cleansed my palette with the remaining ice tea, which I was
          surprised lasted this long.

        <h2 class="chapter_title">The Dessert</h2>
        <p style="grid-area: 2/1/4/3">
          There seemed to be many dessert options and trying them one by one
          made more sense. There were fruits, mainly watermelon, papaya, and
          muskmelon. And thus, I started there. The muskmelon didn't have any
          specific taste and was mostly bland. The papaya and watermelon,
          however, were sweet and tasty.

          On returning to the counter, I was saddened when I discovered that the
          caramel custard and other custard dishes contained eggs and were
          off-limits for me. Nevertheless, I looked for alternatives that were
          for me.

        />
        <p style="grid-area: 2/4/3/5">
          The next item for me was a dish called "Darsaan." It was like sweet
          papad dipped in sugar syrup, with white sesame sprinkled on it. there
          is a similar lovely which I've seen at shops in Kerala and made by my
          community. (I later found out when it was too late that it is part of
          a traditional Chinese dessert eaten with ice cream.)

        <p style="grid-area: 3/4/4/5">
          Done with the Darsaan, I built myself a fabulous ice cream treat. I
          took all three flavors of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, and
          strawberry), topped it with jam (which I feel was made of peach or
          orange or both), then put in choco chips (dark and light,) and then
          got a big spoonful of chocolate from the fountain. It was brilliant.
          My favorite in the mix was the chocolate from the fountain. It was
          liquid when I took it but then turned solid and was chewable. It was a
          wonderful feeling.

          It was not yet over. I still had marshmallows to eat. I got my
          marshmallows on a toothpick and covered it with chocolate from the
          fountain. It was beautiful to watch and eat. The marshmallow alone
          didn't taste much, apart from its signature texture. However, the
          taste of the chocolate was beyond words.

          The war was over. I had tried all the dishes I could, ate my heart's
          content, and it was time to pay the price, Literally. The total bill
          was around 700 rupees, including all the tax and service charges. They
          brought it to me in style, inside a bamboo bottle. I was also served
          some digestive candy, which acts as a mouth freshener.

          All the while, from the main course to having dessert, I was off back
          and forth like a madman taking dishes and trying them out. It's one of
          those rare moments when I didn't feel shy to do such a thing. Just
          doing whatever I wanted, eating things that I liked to my fill. Being
          myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's not that I paid for it, so I was entitled to it. It's just that
          it didn't matter what other people thought. It was my moment, and I
          decided that I was going to live it.

          This was a unique experience and something I enjoyed thoroughly. Would
          I be coming back to this place? Probably not anytime soon. It's too
          expensive for me to dine in regularly. But yes, the experience is
          worth the time and money spent, and this is a place id recommend for
          at least a one-time visit.

          I was pleased with the overall experience. I paid the bill and walked
          out with a content heart. I didn't have to walk far in searching for
          an auto. I saw a bus to Anushakti Nagar as if fate didn't want me to
          digest the food quickly. I boarded it and got my ticket for a mere
          price of 6 rupees. It felt relaxing that after spending about 700
          rupees on lunch, I could return to normalcy and ground myself for the
          next few days. The bus ride was calm, and I returned with more than
          just a filled stomach.
