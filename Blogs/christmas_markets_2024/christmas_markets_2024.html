            <h1>Christmas Markets of 2024</h1>
            <p>Winter 2024</p>
        </hgroup>
        <section>
            <h2>The Motivation</h2>
            <p>Christmas is a festival that is known by almost everyone in the world. It is celebrated as a fun event 
                by even people of other religious backgrounds. Christmas being an event that occurs in the winter is 
                one of the things people look forward to when the sun shines less and less every day and there is 
                almost no motivation for people to move out of their comfort zones.</p>
            <p>Christmas Markets are one of the things that create motivation for people to move out of their houses 
                and walk around with their loved ones. They find reasons to visit other cities, go on dates, or maybe 
                just go out to grab a cup of hot gluwein(kinderpunch in my case LOL)</p>
            <p>Once I saw what these Christmas Markets had to offer, especially those beautiful mugs, I decided to 
                go to as many of them as possible and make the most of the time that people had been telling me is one 
                of the most depressing times of the year.</p>
            
                <h2>Cologne</h2>
                <p>Cologne is one of the most active cities for Christmas Markets.  </p>

            </figure>
            <p> I looked on Google Maps and found that the best way to reach the place would be to catch an auto.
                Finding the shop's
                location was not a big deal it was right on the side of the road and
                had huge boards to welcome people. What surprised me was the change in
                the ambiance as I walked inside the shop.</p>
            <p>I am very well aware that I have not yet mentioned the name of the
                place I'm visiting, although you might have seen the spoiler in the
                title. That's because it's an entire chapter in this story.</p>


            <h2>China Bistro</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../China_Bistro/Images/Outside_1.jpg" class="phone_portrait"
                        alt="Sign board of restaurant" />
                    <figcaption>China Bistro, Mumbai</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The change in ambiance is very apparent as you walk into the hallway
                    from a dusty highway filled with vehicles and people. The noises
                    suddenly disappear, and the atmosphere becomes serene. The transition
                    from chaos to order is apparent. </p>
