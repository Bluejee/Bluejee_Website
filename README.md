# Bluejee_Website

## My Personal Website.

- This website is intended to provide a complete overview of who I am, what I have done in terms of academic and personal projects, and my works and links to my initiatives, such as The Doubt Factory.

## Goals of this Website

This website is built with the following goals in mind:

- Responsiveness: Accessible across any device, big or small, at least those with standard screen sizes.
- Scroll not Click: Requires the minimum number of clicks on the page. Most of the content on this website should be accessible without having to click or redirect to any other page. Only those who want to dive deep into the content or explore the topic need to click on any specific section to look deeper.
- JS-free: Runs on every device without the need for JS. All the content should be displayed, not as a result of a program running behind the browser. People loading this page on a browser, an Emacs-like buffer, or even a terminal must be able to equally access content across the website. Of course, JS can be used for additional creative features, but its absence should still allow for practical use of the website.
- Accessibility and Inclusiveness: This should work well with screen readers and other devices that depend on semantics, alt texts, and other features so anyone can use it.
- Freedom: All the content on the page should ensure true freedom, i.e., freedom of use, and prevent any others from denying this freedom to others. Almost all the content of this website should be Copyright CC_BY_NC_SA. (There can be exceptions where NC might have to be removed, but what all content comes under is still confusing for me.)

## Some Personal Comments

I hope this website helps anyone who wishes to get to know me or in any other way they find helpful. I also hope to maintain this website and make it better every day.

I believe in giving credit wherever it is due, no matter the scale of the contribution. If at any point, anyone who is willing finds a fault or sees scope for improvement, I would love any and all contributions.

With lots of love and hope,
